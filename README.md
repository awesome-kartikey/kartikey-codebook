## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Local Development:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awesome-kartikey/kartikey-cinemate.git
    cd kartikey-codebook
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Mock API Backend:**
    Open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    npx json-server-auth --watch data/db.json --routes data/routes.json --port 8000
    ```

    This will start the mock API server on `http://localhost:8000`. Keep this terminal running.

4.  **Start the React Development Server:**
    Open _another_ terminal in the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the React app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in the terminal) to view it in your browser.

    _Note: The `REACT_APP_HOST` variable in the `.env` file (you might need to create one based on `.env.example` if provided, or leave it as default) should point to `http://localhost:8000` for development._

**Docker Setup:**

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t codebook-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:10000 -e PORT=10000 codebook-app
    ```
    The application (including the `json-server` backend serving the frontend build) will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Note that the Dockerfile is configured for deployment where `json-server` serves the static build and acts as the API simultaneously.
